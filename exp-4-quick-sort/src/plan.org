* Quick Sort
- Tree would be generated using dagre-d3 and html elements.
- The last element will be the pivot.
- The Paritioned array will be displayed just below the original array.
- Then the split arrays will be partitioned into left ,pivot and right arrays.
- Then the quick sort will be applied to the three arrays with approriate ID's
i.e. 3*i-1,3*i and 3*i+1;
- Then the leaf nodes will be combined to form the sorted array along with the approriate labels.
