* Introduction 
  The requirements of =Merge sort experiment= are listed here.

** Requirements
*** Demonstrate the merge sort algorithm.
*** Annotate diagram with split and merge notation.
*** Show the recursive structure of the algorithm in terms of blackboxes.
*** Array is taken as input from the user and user has to input whether space separated input or comma separated input.
*** The tree should have labels of split and merge.
*** A function which should act as a black box in which array will be the input and the tree would be the output.
*** After this experiment we can convert any recursive algorithm into this annotation.
